# Gravity Runner

Game project done in Week 3 of Ironhack's Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp, using P5.js library

## Goal

Create a web-browser MVP game from scratch in 5 days, using P5.js library and/or DOM manipulation.

## Summary

The game is an infinite runner with levels, which consists of helping Major Tom recover his pills and dodge the incoming asteroids, while only being able to control the gravity (on all 4 sides).
Scoring is increased by both pill collecting and survival time.
